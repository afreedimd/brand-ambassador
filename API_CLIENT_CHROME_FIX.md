# API Client Chrome Fix

## ‚úÖ **Chrome fromJson Errors Fixed!**

### **Issue Identified:**
When trying to run the Flutter app on Chrome, you were getting:
```
Error: The method 'fromJson' isn't defined for the type 'Type'.
MapEntry(k, dynamic.fromJson(v as Map<String, dynamic>)));
```

### **Root Cause:**
The API client was using `Future<Map<String, dynamic>>` return types for many endpoints, which caused Retrofit to generate problematic JSON serialization code that tried to call `fromJson` on the `dynamic` type.

### **Solution Applied:**
Updated the API client to use `Future<HttpResponse<Map<String, dynamic>>>` for endpoints that return generic data, while keeping direct model types for auth and user endpoints.

### **Changes Made:**

#### **Before (Problematic):**
```dart
@GET('/campaigns')
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> getCampaigns(@Queries() Map<String, dynamic>? queries);

@GET('/analytics/dashboard')
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> getDashboardAnalytics();
```

#### **After (Fixed):**
```dart
@GET('/campaigns')
Future<HttpResponse<Map<String, dynamic>>> getCampaigns(@Queries() Map<String, dynamic>? queries);

@GET('/analytics/dashboard')
Future<HttpResponse<Map<String, dynamic>>> getDashboardAnalytics();
```

### **Why This Works:**
- `HttpResponse<Map<String, dynamic>>` tells Retrofit to wrap the response in an HttpResponse object
- This avoids the problematic JSON serialization that was trying to call `fromJson` on `dynamic`
- The auth and user endpoints still use direct model types (`AuthResponse`, `UserModel`) which work correctly

### **Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Critical fromJson Errors**: 0 (All Fixed!)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings**: 1 (Non-blocking)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info Issues**: 115 (Style suggestions only)

### **Result:**
The Flutter app can now run successfully on Chrome without the `fromJson` errors. The API client generates clean, working code that properly handles both typed responses and generic Map responses.

## üöÄ **Ready for Chrome Development!**

Your Flutter app is now ready to run on Chrome and other web platforms! üéâ
