# Final Error Fixes Summary

## ✅ **All Critical Errors Successfully Resolved!**

### **Latest Fixes Applied:**

#### 1. **Font Asset Errors** ✅
- **Issue**: `Error: unable to locate asset entry in pubspec.yaml: "assets/fonts/Outfit-Regular.ttf"`
- **Root Cause**: pubspec.yaml referenced font files that didn't exist
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed all font references from `pubspec.yaml`
  - Updated `app_theme.dart` to remove `fontFamily` properties
  - App now uses system fonts (cleaner and more reliable)

#### 2. **API Client fromJson Errors** ✅
- **Issue**: Multiple `fromJson` method errors in generated `api_client.g.dart`
- **Root Cause**: Retrofit was trying to generate JSON serialization for generic `Map<String, dynamic>` types
- **Solution**:
  - Updated API client to use proper model types (`AuthResponse`, `UserModel`)
  - Simplified remaining endpoints to use `Map<String, dynamic>` without `HttpResponse` wrapper
  - Regenerated code with `build_runner` - all errors resolved
