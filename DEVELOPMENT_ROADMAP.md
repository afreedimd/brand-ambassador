## üìã **Development Guidelines**

### **For Each Screen Development:**

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/screen-name
   ```

2. **Follow Architecture Pattern**
   - Create feature folder: `lib/features/[feature_name]/`
   - Implement BLoC pattern: `presentation/bloc/`
   - Add domain logic: `domain/usecases/`
   - Create data layer: `data/repositories/`

3. **Use Shared Components**
   - Leverage existing widgets in `lib/shared/widgets/`
   - Follow design system in `lib/core/theme/`
   - Use common utilities in `lib/core/utils/`

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Widget tests for UI components
   - Integration tests for user flows

5. **Documentation**
   - Update this roadmap with completion status
   - Add screen documentation in feature folder
   - Update API documentation if needed

### **Collaboration Guidelines:**

- **No Conflicts**: Each developer works on different screens
- **Shared Components**: Use common widgets to avoid duplication
- **Code Reviews**: All changes must be reviewed before merging
- **Testing**: Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

### **Quality Standards:**

- **Performance**: < 3s screen load time
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators
